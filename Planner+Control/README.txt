There have been problems with my controller from ph2 translating to ph3. Also, I have checked to see that even when the pos and vel errors are under the tolerance specified by the simulator, it keeps running. I have not been able to pinpoint the problem here. I hope to figure this out by the time we run this on an actual quadrotor, but in the meantime, the ouptut is not something that can be considered great.
